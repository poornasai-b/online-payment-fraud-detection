## 📊 Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Real-time Fraud Monitoring  
The system analyzes transaction attributes such as amount, balances, and transaction type to flag suspicious activity.

### Scenario 2: Fraudulent Account Detection  
User transaction patterns over time are analyzed to detect suspicious or fraudulent accounts.

### Scenario 3: Adaptive Fraud Prevention  
The system can be periodically retrained to adapt to evolving fraud patterns.

- xgboost
- pickle-mixin
- jupyter
- notebook


## 📊 Training the Model

### Step 1: Open Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Training Folder
Open `training/ONLINE PAYMENTS FRAUD DETECTION.ipynb`

### Step 3: Run All Cells
Execute all cells in sequence to:
1. Load and preprocess data
2. Perform exploratory data analysis
3. Train 5 different ML models
4. Compare model performances
5. Save the best model as `payments.pkl`

### Key Training Steps
- **Data Preprocessing**: Drop unnecessary columns, handle missing values
- **EDA**: Univariate, bivariate, and descriptive analysis
- **Feature Engineering**: Label encoding for categorical variables
- **Model Training**: Train and evaluate 5 classifiers
- **Model Selection**: Choose SVC as the best performer
- **Model Saving**: Export model using pickle

## 🌐 Running the Web Application

### Step 1: Navigate to Flask Folder
```bash
cd flask
```

### Step 2: Run the Flask App
```bash
python app.py
```

### Step 3: Access the Application
Open your web browser and navigate to:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

### Step 4: Use the Application
1. Click on **"Predict"** button in the navigation bar
2. Enter transaction details:
   - Step (e.g., 94)
   - Type (0-4: CASH_IN, CASH_OUT, DEBIT, PAYMENT, TRANSFER)
   - Amount (e.g., 14.590090)
   - OldbalanceOrg (e.g., 2169679.91)
   - NewbalanceOrig (e.g., 0.0)
   - OldbalanceDest (e.g., 0.00)
   - NewbalanceDest (e.g., 0.00)

- True Negatives (Correctly identified legitimate)
- False Positives (Legitimate flagged as fraud)
- False Negatives (Fraud missed)

### Classification Report
Includes:
- Precision: Accuracy of positive predictions
- Recall: Ability to find all positive instances

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- Model predictions should be used as one factor in fraud detection
- Always combine ML predictions with other security measures
- Regularly retrain model with new data
- Monitor false positive/negative rates
- Implement proper authentication and authorization

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add real-time data streaming integration
- [ ] Implement model retraining pipeline
- [ ] Create admin dashboard for monitoring
- [ ] Add user authentication system
- [ ] Deploy to cloud (AWS, Azure, Heroku)
- [ ] Implement REST API endpoints
- [ ] Add ensemble methods for improved accuracy
- [ ] Include explainability features (SHAP, LIME)
- [ ] Add email/SMS alerts for fraud detection
- [ ] Implement A/B testing for model versions

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Model file not found
**Solution**: Ensure you've run the Jupyter notebook and generated `payments.pkl` in the flask folder.

### Issue: Dataset not found
**Solution**: Download the dataset and place it in the `data/` folder with the correct filename.

### Issue: Port 5000 already in use
**Solution**: Change the port in `app.py`:
```python
app.run(debug=False, port=5001)
```

### Issue: Module not found errors
**Solution**: Install all dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
